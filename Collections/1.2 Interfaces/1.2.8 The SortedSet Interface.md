### 1.2.8 The SortedSet Interface
SortedSet 是按升序维护其元素的 Set，根据元素的自然顺序或根据 SortedSet 创建时 Comparator 提供的顺序进行排序。除正常 Set 操作外，SortedSet 接口还提供以下操作：

- Range view - 允许对已排序集进行任意范围操作
- Endpoints - 返回有序集合中的第一个或最后一个元素
- Comparator access- 返回用于对集合进行排序的 Comparator（如果有）
SortedSet 接口的代码如下。

```
public interface SortedSet<E> extends Set<E> {
    // Range-view
    SortedSet<E> subSet(E fromElement, E toElement);
    SortedSet<E> headSet(E toElement);
    SortedSet<E> tailSet(E fromElement);

    // Endpoints
    E first();
    E last();

    // Comparator access
    Comparator<? super E> comparator();
}
```

#### Set Operations
The operations that SortedSet inherits from Set behave identically on sorted sets and normal sets with two exceptions:

- The Iterator returned by the iterator operation traverses the sorted set in order.
- The array returned by toArray contains the sorted set's elements in order.

Although the interface doesn't guarantee it, the toString method of the Java platform's SortedSet implementations returns a string containing all the elements of the sorted set, in order.

SortedSet 继承自 Set 的操作在排序集和普通集上的行为相同，但有两个例外：

- 在Iterator由返回iterator以便在操作遍历有序集合。
- 返回的数组toArray按顺序包含有序集的元素。

虽然接口不保证它，但toStringJava平台SortedSet实现的方法按顺序返回包含有序集的所有元素的字符串。

#### Standard Constructors
按照惯例，所有通用 Collection 实现都提供了一个带有 Collection 的标准转换构造函数，SortedSet 实现也不例外。在 TreeSet 中，此构造函数创建一个根据其自然顺序对其元素进行排序的实例。这可能是一个错误。最好动态检查以查看指定的集合是否是 SortedSet 实例，如果是，则根据相同的标准（比较器或自然排序）对新的 TreeSet 进行排序。因为 TreeSet 采用了它所采用的方法，所以它还提供了一个构造函数，它接受一个 SortedSet 并返回一个新的 TreeSet，它包含根据相同标准排序的相同元素。请注意，它是参数的编译时类型，而不是其运行时类型，它确定调用这两个构造函数中的哪一个（以及是否保留了排序条件）。

按照惯例，SortedSet 实现还提供了一个构造函数，它接受 Comparator 并返回根据指定的 Comparator 排序的空集。如果将 null 传递给此构造函数，则返回一个集合，该集合根据其自然顺序对其元素进行排序。

#### Range-view Operations
The range-view operations are somewhat analogous to those provided by the List interface, but there is one big difference. Range views of a sorted set remain valid even if the backing sorted set is modified directly. This is feasible because the endpoints of a range view of a sorted set are absolute points in the element space rather than specific elements in the backing collection, as is the case for lists. A range-view of a sorted set is really just a window onto whatever portion of the set lies in the designated part of the element space. Changes to the range-view write back to the backing sorted set and vice versa. Thus, it's okay to use range-views on sorted sets for long periods of time, unlike range-views on lists.

Sorted sets provide three range-view operations. The first, subSet, takes two endpoints, like subList. Rather than indices, the endpoints are objects and must be comparable to the elements in the sorted set, using the Set's Comparator or the natural ordering of its elements, whichever the Set uses to order itself. Like subList, the range is half open, including its low endpoint but excluding the high one.

Thus, the following line of code tells you how many words between "doorbell" and "pickle", including "doorbell" but excluding "pickle", are contained in a SortedSet of strings called dictionary:

```int count = dictionary.subSet("doorbell", "pickle").size();```

In like manner, the following one-liner removes all the elements beginning with the letter f.

```dictionary.subSet("f", "g").clear();```

A similar trick can be used to print a table telling you how many words begin with each letter.

```
for (char ch = 'a'; ch <= 'z'; ) {
    String from = String.valueOf(ch++);
    String to = String.valueOf(ch);
    System.out.println(from + ": " + dictionary.subSet(from, to).size());
}
```

Suppose you want to view a closed interval, which contains both of its endpoints, instead of an open interval. If the element type allows for the calculation of the successor of a given value in the element space, merely request the subSet from lowEndpoint to successor(highEndpoint). Although it isn't entirely obvious, the successor of a string s in String's natural ordering is s + "\0" — that is, s with a null character appended.

Thus, the following one-liner tells you how many words between "doorbell" and "pickle", including doorbell and pickle, are contained in the dictionary.

```count = dictionary.subSet("doorbell", "pickle\0").size();```

A similar technique can be used to view an open interval, which contains neither endpoint. The open-interval view from lowEndpoint to highEndpoint is the half-open interval from successor(lowEndpoint) to highEndpoint. Use the following to calculate the number of words between "doorbell" and "pickle", excluding both.

```count = dictionary.subSet("doorbell\0", "pickle").size();```

The SortedSet interface contains two more range-view operations — headSet and tailSet, both of which take a single Object argument. The former returns a view of the initial portion of the backing SortedSet, up to but not including the specified object. The latter returns a view of the final portion of the backing SortedSet, beginning with the specified object and continuing to the end of the backing SortedSet. Thus, the following code allows you to view the dictionary as two disjoint volumes (a-m and n-z).

```
SortedSet<String> volume1 = dictionary.headSet("n");
SortedSet<String> volume2 = dictionary.tailSet("n");
```

#### Endpoint Operations
The SortedSet interface contains operations to return the first and last elements in the sorted set, not surprisingly called first and last. In addition to their obvious uses, last allows a workaround for a deficiency in the SortedSet interface. One thing you'd like to do with a SortedSet is to go into the interior of the Set and iterate forward or backward. It's easy enough to go forward from the interior: Just get a tailSet and iterate over it. Unfortunately, there's no easy way to go backward.

The following idiom obtains the first element that is less than a specified object o in the element space.

```Object predecessor = ss.headSet(o).last();```

This is a fine way to go one element backward from a point in the interior of a sorted set. It could be applied repeatedly to iterate backward, but this is very inefficient, requiring a lookup for each element returned.

#### Comparator Accessor
The SortedSet interface contains an accessor method called comparator that returns the Comparator used to sort the set, or null if the set is sorted according to the natural ordering of its elements. This method is provided so that sorted sets can be copied into new sorted sets with the same ordering. It is used by the SortedSet constructor described previously.
