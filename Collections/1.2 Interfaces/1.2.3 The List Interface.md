### 1.2.3 The List Interface
List是一个有序的 Collection（有时称为序列）。列表可能包含重复元素。除了从 Collection 继承的操作之外，List 接口还包括以下操作：

- Positional access — 根据列表中的数字位置操纵元素。这包括 `get`，`set`，`add`，`addAll`和`remove`等方法。
- Search — 搜索列表中的指定对象并返回其数字位置。搜索方法包括`indexOf`和`lastIndexOf`。
- Iteration — 扩展 Iterator 语义以利用列表的顺序性。`listIterator` 方法提供此行为。
- Range-view —  `sublist ` 方法对列表执行任意范围操作。

Java 平台包含两个主要的 List 实现：

- ArrayList，通常是性能更好的实现
- LinkedList，在某些情况下提供更好的性能

#### Collection Operations
假设您已经熟悉它们，那么从 Collection 继承的操作都可以完成您期望它们做的事情 如果您不熟悉Collection，现在是阅读 [The Collection Interface]() 部分的好时机。

- `remove` 操作始终从列表中删除指定元素的第一个匹配项。 
- `add`和`addAll`操作始终将新元素附加到列表的末尾。因此，以下用法将一个列表连接到另一个列表。

```list1.addAll(list2);```

这是这个用法的非破坏性形式，它产生第三个 List，其中包含附加到第一个列表的第二个列表。

```
List<Type> list3 = new ArrayList<Type>(list1);
list3.addAll(list2);
```

请注意，非破坏性形式用法利用了 ArrayList 的标准转换构造函数。

这是一个将一些 names 聚合到 List 中的示例（JDK 8 及更高版本）：

```
List<String> list = people.stream().map(Person::getName)
.collect(Collectors.toList());
```

与 Se t接口一样，List 增强了对 equals 和 hashCode 方法的要求，因此可以比较两个 List 对象的逻辑相等性，而不考虑它们的实现类。如果两个List对象包含相同顺序的相同元素，则它们是相等的。

#### Positional Access and Search Operations
The basic positional access operations are get, set, add and remove. (The set and remove operations return the old value that is being overwritten or removed.) Other operations (indexOf and lastIndexOf) return the first or last index of the specified element in the list.
The addAll operation inserts all the elements of the specified Collection starting at the specified position. The elements are inserted in the order they are returned by the specified Collection's iterator. This call is the positional access analog of Collection's addAll operation.

Here's a little method to swap two indexed values in a List.

```
public static <E> void swap(List<E> a, int i, int j) {
    E tmp = a.get(i);
    a.set(i, a.get(j));
    a.set(j, tmp);
}
```

Of course, there's one big difference. This is a polymorphic algorithm: It swaps two elements in any List, regardless of its implementation type. Here's another polymorphic algorithm that uses the preceding swap method.

```
public static void shuffle(List<?> list, Random rnd) {
    for (int i = list.size(); i > 1; i--)
        swap(list, i - 1, rnd.nextInt(i));
}
```

This algorithm, which is included in the Java platform's Collections class, randomly permutes the specified list using the specified source of randomness. It's a bit subtle: It runs up the list from the bottom, repeatedly swapping a randomly selected element into the current position. Unlike most naive attempts at shuffling, it's fair (all permutations occur with equal likelihood, assuming an unbiased source of randomness) and fast (requiring exactly list.size()-1 swaps). The following program uses this algorithm to print the words in its argument list in random order.

```
import java.util.*;

public class Shuffle {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();
        for (String a : args)
            list.add(a);
        Collections.shuffle(list, new Random());
        System.out.println(list);
    }
}
```

In fact, this program can be made even shorter and faster. The Arrays class has a static factory method called asList, which allows an array to be viewed as a List. This method does not copy the array. Changes in the List write through to the array and vice versa. The resulting List is not a general-purpose List implementation, because it doesn't implement the (optional) add and remove operations: Arrays are not resizable. Taking advantage of Arrays.asList and calling the library version of shuffle, which uses a default source of randomness, you get the following tiny program whose behavior is identical to the previous program.

```
import java.util.*;

public class Shuffle {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> list = Arrays.asList(args);
        Collections.shuffle(list);
        System.out.println(list);
    }
}
```

#### Iterators
As you'd expect, the Iterator returned by List's iterator operation returns the elements of the list in proper sequence. List also provides a richer iterator, called a ListIterator, which allows you to traverse the list in either direction, modify the list during iteration, and obtain the current position of the iterator.

The three methods that ListIterator inherits from Iterator (hasNext, next, and remove) do exactly the same thing in both interfaces. The hasPrevious and the previous operations are exact analogues of hasNext and next. The former operations refer to the element before the (implicit) cursor, whereas the latter refer to the element after the cursor. The previous operation moves the cursor backward, whereas next moves it forward.

Here's the standard idiom for iterating backward through a list.

```
for (ListIterator<Type> it = list.listIterator(list.size()); it.hasPrevious(); ) {
    Type t = it.previous();
    ...
}
```

Note the argument to listIterator in the preceding idiom. The List interface has two forms of the listIterator method. The form with no arguments returns a ListIterator positioned at the beginning of the list; the form with an int argument returns a ListIterator positioned at the specified index. The index refers to the element that would be returned by an initial call to next. An initial call to previous would return the element whose index was index-1. In a list of length n, there are n+1 valid values for index, from 0 to n, inclusive.

Intuitively speaking, the cursor is always between two elements — the one that would be returned by a call to previous and the one that would be returned by a call to next. The n+1 valid index values correspond to the n+1 gaps between elements, from the gap before the first element to the gap after the last one. The following figure shows the five possible cursor positions in a list containing four elements.

<center>The five possible cursor positions.</center>

Calls to next and previous can be intermixed, but you have to be a bit careful. The first call to previous returns the same element as the last call to next. Similarly, the first call to next after a sequence of calls to previous returns the same element as the last call to previous.

It should come as no surprise that the nextIndex method returns the index of the element that would be returned by a subsequent call to next, and previousIndex returns the index of the element that would be returned by a subsequent call to previous. These calls are typically used either to report the position where something was found or to record the position of the ListIterator so that another ListIterator with identical position can be created.

It should also come as no surprise that the number returned by nextIndex is always one greater than the number returned by previousIndex. This implies the behavior of the two boundary cases: (1) a call to previousIndex when the cursor is before the initial element returns -1 and (2) a call to nextIndex when the cursor is after the final element returns list.size(). To make all this concrete, the following is a possible implementation of List.indexOf.

```
public int indexOf(E e) {
    for (ListIterator<E> it = listIterator(); it.hasNext(); )
        if (e == null ? it.next() == null : e.equals(it.next()))
            return it.previousIndex();
    // Element not found
    return -1;
}
```

Note that the indexOf method returns it.previousIndex() even though it is traversing the list in the forward direction. The reason is that it.nextIndex() would return the index of the element we are about to examine, and we want to return the index of the element we just examined.

The Iterator interface provides the remove operation to remove the last element returned by next from the Collection. For ListIterator, this operation removes the last element returned by next or previous. The ListIterator interface provides two additional operations to modify the list — set and add. The set method overwrites the last element returned by next or previous with the specified element. The following polymorphic algorithm uses set to replace all occurrences of one specified value with another.

```
public static <E> void replace(List<E> list, E val, E newVal) {
    for (ListIterator<E> it = list.listIterator(); it.hasNext(); )
        if (val == null ? it.next() == null : val.equals(it.next()))
            it.set(newVal);
}
```

The only bit of trickiness in this example is the equality test between val and it.next. You need to special-case a val value of null to prevent a NullPointerException.

The add method inserts a new element into the list immediately before the current cursor position. This method is illustrated in the following polymorphic algorithm to replace all occurrences of a specified value with the sequence of values contained in the specified list.

```
public static <E> 
    void replace(List<E> list, E val, List<? extends E> newVals) {
    for (ListIterator<E> it = list.listIterator(); it.hasNext(); ){
        if (val == null ? it.next() == null : val.equals(it.next())) {
            it.remove();
            for (E e : newVals)
                it.add(e);
        }
    }
}
```
